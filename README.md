This is a Dockerized Rails app with two approaches to set up Github Actions workflow for tests.
There is a .devcontainer folder on it, so you can use Vscode to open it inside a container (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers).

Then run:

bundle install

yarn install

rails db:prepare
